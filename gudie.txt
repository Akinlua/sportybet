## Rule 2: Hybrid Rule (One Exact Match + One Similarity Match)

**Priority:** Second (only executed if Rule 1 finds no matches)  
**Condition:** One team matches exactly (normalized) AND the other team has ≥50% similarity

### How It Works

1. Calculates all possible similarity combinations:
   - Query Team 1 vs Database Team 1
   - Query Team 1 vs Database Team 2
   - Query Team 2 vs Database Team 1
   - Query Team 2 vs Database Team 2

2. Checks for exact matches (normalized team names are identical)

3. Applies hybrid rule if any of these conditions are met:
   - **Case 1:** Query Team 1 = Database Team 1 (exact) AND Query Team 2 similarity with Database Team 2 ≥ 50%
   - **Case 2:** Query Team 1 = Database Team 2 (exact) AND Query Team 2 similarity with Database Team 1 ≥ 50%
   - **Case 3:** Query Team 2 = Database Team 1 (exact) AND Query Team 1 similarity with Database Team 2 ≥ 50%
   - **Case 4:** Query Team 2 = Database Team 2 (exact) AND Query Team 1 similarity with Database Team 1 ≥ 50%

   Ignore all that talk of rule 1
